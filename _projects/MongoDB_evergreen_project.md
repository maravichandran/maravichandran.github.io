During summer 2020, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). My co-intern and I created a data pipeline within the [Evergreen](https://github.com/evergreen-ci) continuous integration (CI) system that logs system metrics on the hosts running the CI tests, transforms them into structured data, and stores them in the data sink for access via a REST API, enabling diagnosis of system failures via machine learning and visualization of the system metric data. 

My code is open-source and can be found in the [Cedar](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/cedar), [FTDC](https://github.com/mongodb/ftdc), and [Evergreen](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen) repositiories.
