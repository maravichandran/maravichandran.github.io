Hi! My name is Maya. I am currently a Machine Learning Research Intern at Netflix and am based in the NYC area. 

Prior to joining Netflix, I was an ML Engineer at Regrello, where I worked on a multi-agent LLM system for auto-generating supply chain workflows. I completed an MSc in Advanced Computer Science at University of Oxford and an MPhil in Therapeutic Sciences at University of Cambridge on the [Marshall Scholarship](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/). I also hold a B.S. in Computer Science from Rutgers University-New Brunswick. I have interned at MongoDB, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and the National Institutes of Health.

My favorite hobbies are birding (286 species seen!), classical music (vioin/piano), hiking, and reading (usually classic literature). 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
